# Python Data Structure Queues
## what is a Queue?
A Queue is a line of objects in with in order. Queues are all around us in real life but one of the most common queue we see everyday is a line in a shopping center or at the water park. The first person in line is the first person to get picked and the last person goes last and when you want to join the queue you get in the back of the line. The same can go for programing. You can make programs wait in a queue for there function to be performed or you can have objects wait in line to be acted on.
