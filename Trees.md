# Python Data Structure Trees
## what is a Tree
A tree is like a linked list in that Node connects to another node but unlike linked lists tree nodes connect to multiple different nodes. the top node in a tree is called a root and each node is a parent and the nodes that connect to it are called a child lastly a node that does not have any child nodes are known as leaf nodes or end nodes.

## Binary search trees
A Binary search tree is a method of using trees. You use this type of tree buy saving a value in the nodes. When place or looking for a value you start at the root and move left or right depending on if the value is greater then or less the nodes value.

With this image we can see that if we are looking fro the number 6 we start at the root node (8) 8>6 so we move to the left now we look at the node (3) 6>3 so we move to the right 6==6 so this is the node that 6 is at.

## commands and Big O
Operation | Description | Performance
-------- | -------- | --------
insert(Value)| place a value in a new node | O(logn) Recursively search the subtrees to find the next available spot
remove(Value)|blank| blank
contains(Value)|Blank|blank
traverse_forward|blank|blank
traverse_reverse|blank|blank
height(node)|blank|blank
size()|blank|blank
empty|blank|blank
